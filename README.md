# paste-latex-to-onenote-ahk
 Paste Latex string to Onenote as equation. MS doesn't care about things that can't make much profit so...

# Usage
 Copy Latex, switch to Onenote, move the cursor to desired location, hit Ctrl+Space to paste as equation.
 
# Caveates
 Can only support things that math mode does.
 Does not support some multi-line environments such as {cases}

# Multilingual font problemï¼š
 Edit the *preferred_font* variable in the script so it automatically switches to the preferred font after inserting equation.
